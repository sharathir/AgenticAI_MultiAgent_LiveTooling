1. Choose a Live API and Get a Key
API: We will use OpenWeatherMap (or any similar service).

Action: We need a function to get the current or forecasted weather for a given location, which directly impacts property risk (e.g., severe storm warnings).

2. Define the Live Tool (Python Function with requests)
We will replace the mock logic in get_applicant_risk_score with a real API call.

3. Update the AutoGen Configuration
The Underwriting_Agent's system message will be updated to instruct it to use the new, real tool.

Based on the search results, OpenWeatherMap is an excellent choice for a live API integration due to its free tier and straightforward JSON response structure. We will integrate a function to fetch current weather data for a specified city, which an underwriting agent can use to assess property risk (e.g., is a storm imminent?).
